## Get CAF

### FreeBSD Ports

We maintain a port for CAF, which you can install as follows:

```sh
pkg install caf
```

Alternatively, you can go to `/usr/ports/devel/caf` and tweak a few
configuration options before installing the port:

```sh
make config
make install clean
```

### Homebrew

You can install the latest stable release with:

```sh
brew install caf
```

Alternatively, you can use the current development version by using:

```sh
brew install caf --HEAD
```

### Conan

A [Conan](https://conan.io/) recipe for CAF along with pre-built libraries
for most platforms are available at [Conan Center](https://conan.io/center/caf/stable/?user=bincrafters&channel=stable).

### VCPKG

You can build and install CAF using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager with a single command:

```sh
vcpkg install caf
```

The caf port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors.

## Get the Sources

* git clone https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework.git
* cd actor-framework

## Build CAF from Source

The easiest way to build CAF is to use the `configure` script. Other available
options are using [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) directly or
[SNocs](https://github.com/airutech/snocs).

### Using the `configure` Script

The script is a convenient frontend for `CMake`. See `configure -h`
for a list of available options or read the
[online documentation](https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework/wiki/Configure-Options).

```sh
./configure
cd build
make
make test
make install [as root, optional]
```

### Using CMake

All available CMake variables are available
[online](https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework/wiki/CMake-Options).
CAF also can be included as CMake submodule or added as dependency to other
CMake-based projects. The latter can be achieved by calling
```cmake
find_package(CAF REQUIRED)
```
in respective project's CMake file. CAF's install location (e.g. by providing
the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` option) has to be known.

### Using SNocs

A SNocs workspace is provided by GitHub user
[osblinnikov](https://github.com/osblinnikov) and documented
[online](https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework/wiki/Using-SNocs).

## Dependencies

* CMake
* Pthread (until C++11 compilers support the new `thread_local` keyword)

## Supported Compilers

* GCC >= 7
* Clang >= 4
* MSVC >= 2019

## Supported Operating Systems

* Linux
* Mac OS X
* FreeBSD 10
* Windows >= 7 (currently static builds only)

## Build Documentation Locally

- Building an offline version of the manual requires
  [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org):
  ```sh
  cd manual
  sphinx-build . html
  ```
- Building an offline version of the API reference documentation requires
  [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl) (simply run the  `doxygen` command at the
  root directory of the repository).
